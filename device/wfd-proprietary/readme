How to do wifi display unit test using Ethernet?

*Take two board. Plug in Ethernet tables into the same network.

*Run netcfg command in console respectively to get two ip address. E.g. 10.192.241.13 & 10.192.241.15

*Start wfd server and client to run the test.

 For example:

        #wfd -l 10.192.241.13:1234-------This is server listening on 10.192.241.13 port number 1234
        #wfd -c 10.192.241.13:1234-------This is client which will connect to server above.
